			<h1> Why am I at MATTER today? </h1>
			<h1> When I was a kid, I used to code in Basic. </h1>
			<h1> Now, I don't know how to code, but I want to know more. </h1><p></p>


			<h1> Our firm develops software, we store code on Github, I should have a basic understanding of coding AND our developers are tired of me asking the same questions. </h1>
			<h1> Time to learn! </h1>
